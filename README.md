This program syncronises video playback across multiple mpv instances.

## Building it

Install Go and you should be good to go.

```bash
make
```

## A single binary to rule them all

Server and client are the same binary, so hardlinking them works fine. If you
name the binary `univiewd` and run it, it will open a server on `:1558` you can
connect to.

## Roadmap

- Support playback queues
- API docs
- CI Pipeline
- a UI for managing the queue
- better handling of web streams
- bugsquashing
